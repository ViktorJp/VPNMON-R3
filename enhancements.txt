To-Do:
- If the WAN doesn't respond after X minutes, issue a router reboot?
- Option for round-robin on lists, instead of random.

Done:
- Show which slot was having ping issues (@scootertramp)
- Add the Interface IP as a required field for the WG Server Lists @Ventola
- Invalid ping response values in log
- "Time Connected" in UI
- Router Uptime on WAN entry in UI
- Remove RL tag if amtm email functionality is turned off completely, and show some info in the config menu on the AMTM email item.
- Get unbound over WG working
- Specify how many times you want cycle to go before a reset occurs (right now it's every cycle, but could make it 2 or 3?)
- Option to show/hide OVPN and WG sections. @Stephen Harrington
- Wireguard compatibility
- *** if downloaded list = 0, then dont save list and preserve, and email
- Run "sh /jffs/scripts/spdMerlin.sh reset_interfaces force" whenever vpnmon-r3 resets - needs menu item. (iTyPsIDg)
- *** fix router model/build in email -- VPNMON-R3!
- Custom IP to do WAN check against (to remove need for 8.8.8.8 for those who block google)
- AMTM Email notifications on: WAN Restore, VPN Reconnections
- Skynet whitelist your vpn ip server lists
- ping reset > ms
- add ip address/host to log when it disconnects
- method: Get to usable operations menu before wan/vpn checks
- Monitoring for WAN drops/outages as in R2
- Automate running of custom CURL statements under server list automation using CRON
- Create a separate thread with CURL examples for all R2-supported VPN providers
- Add ping values to main UI
- Build a VPN Server List builder that exports IPs into a certain Client Slot txt file
- Consider building Unbound tie-in

Nixed:
- Possibility: Integrate KILLMON functionality if there is any interest in having better killswitch capabilities (Nixed in favor of Router UI killswitch implementation)
